# ICA on Mixed Images

Usage of ICA to separate two mixed images, based on Nathan Kutz lecture.

# About this project

Implementation of ICA (a.k.a. Independent Component Analysis) to separate two images which were mixed. This code is based on the lecture of Nathan Kutz, professor of Applied Math at Washington University. For this technique to work, it is imperative that all original components to be **INDEPENDENT AND NON GAUSSIAN**, so that they can be separated.

# Getting Started

**Prerequisites**

To run the algorithms in this repo, you'll need to have Python 3 (and Anaconda) installed.

**Installing Anaconda**

Instalation of Anaconda in Linux Ubuntu 18.04 can be found
